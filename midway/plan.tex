\section{Project Plan}

In the next steps, we are planning to
firstly conduct several experiments to figure out the reasons of Yolo poor performances on detecting pedestrians. 
Then we will build a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model for detecting cars, pedestrians and cyclists on a smaller dataset due to lack of computation power. 
We also will explore some possible methods for estimating 3D object orientation.
