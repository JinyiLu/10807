\section{Experiment Results}
In this section, we will discuss some of the primary experiment results that we have achieved.

Firstly, we directly use the provided pretrained yolo model to make prediction our development set. This yolo model is trained using VOC2012 dataset so it contains about 20 categories including car, people, bicycle, etc. In order to solve our problem, we consider the people it detected as the pedestrian category that we want and detected bicycle as the cyclist that we want.
