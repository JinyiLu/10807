In terms of the model performance, we use the two pre-trained 
models as the baseline for comparsion.
As we can see from the precision-recall curve and the average precision results, for cars, best result is achieved by 
using a Find-tuned Faster R-CNN models and there is 
no significant difference between which convolutional networks 
to be used for generating feature map probability because 
these two convolutional networks are very similar 
and have the same depth.
In terms of yolo, 
a fine-tuned tiny yolo model don't have a significant 
improvement compare to the one using the pre-trained model.
However, a fine-tuned big yolo mdoel do improve the performance 
a lot thanks to the deeper network.
For pedestrian, the performance of models are quite similar,
fine-tuned Faster R-CNN models achieve the best results. 
And a fine-tuned big yolo model improves the baseline while 
a fine-tuned tiny yolo model shows no significant improvement.
