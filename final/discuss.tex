As we can see from the precision-recall curve and the average precision results, for pedestrians, Faster-RCNN outperforms yolo models a lot in all three difficulty levels. And a fine-tuned tiny yolo model on our dataset shows no improvement compared with the pre-trained yolo model. For cars, Faster-RCNN outperforms yolo models in easy level. And our fine-tuned tiny yolo model shows great improvement in all three difficulty levels compared with the pre-traiend yolo model. And
in terms of predicting speed, the fine-tuned tiny yolo can achieve about 70 fps and the pre-trained Faster-RCNN can only achieve about 2 fps.
